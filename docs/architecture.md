# Codex Architecture

## Three-Part Relationship Model

Codex operates within a triangular relationship model that creates a quality-assured development ecosystem:

### 1. Human Developer
- **Role**: Strategic decision-maker and requirements provider
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Define project goals and requirements
  - Review high-level guidance from Codex
  - Make final decisions on code acceptance/rejection
  - Provide context and domain expertise

### 2. AI Assistant (Co-Assist)
- **Role**: Code generator and implementer  
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Generate code based on human requirements
  - Implement specific features and functionality
  - Respond to Codex feedback and suggestions
  - Utilize Codex MCP/CLI interfaces for enhanced collaboration

### 3. Codex Monitor
- **Role**: Quality guardian and strategic advisor
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Real-time monitoring of code generation
  - Pattern analysis and quality assessment  
  - Hallucination detection and prevention
  - High-level project goal alignment
  - Providing MCP/CLI interfaces for AI assistant integration

## Interaction Flows

### Primary Flow: Code Generation with Oversight
```
1. Human provides requirements → AI Assistant
2. AI Assistant generates code → Codex monitors in real-time
3. Codex analyzes quality/alignment → Provides feedback
4. Codex reports to Human with strategic guidance
5. Human makes decisions based on Codex insights
```

### Secondary Flow: Proactive Assistance
```
1. Codex identifies patterns/issues → Provides MCP/CLI guidance to AI Assistant
2. AI Assistant adjusts approach based on Codex recommendations
3. Improved code generation → Better alignment with project goals
```
