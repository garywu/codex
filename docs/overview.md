# Codex Project Overview

## Vision Statement

Codex is a universal code analysis and quality assurance stack that serves as an intelligent gatekeeper between AI-generated code and production systems, ensuring high-quality, purpose-driven code through pre-commit analysis while preventing hallucinations and maintaining project coherence.

## Core Concept

Codex operates within a **three-part relationship**:

```
Human Developer ←→ AI Assistant ←→ Codex Monitor
```

This creates a quality-assured development workflow where:
- **AI Assistant** (initially Claude Code CLI) generates code based on requirements
- **Codex** analyzes and validates the generated code at pre-commit time
- **Human Developer** receives feedback and automatic fixes before code is committed

## Primary Purpose

Codex functions as an "assistant to the assistant" - providing comprehensive pre-commit analysis of AI-generated code to ensure:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Pre-commit detection of poor coding patterns and potential issues using multi-factor analysis
2. **Hallucination Prevention**: Identification and flagging of AI-generated code that references non-existent APIs or incorrect patterns
3. **Goal Convergence**: High-level guidance to ensure generated code serves the project's actual use case and objectives
4. **Automatic Fixing**: Optional automatic correction of detected issues before commit
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Multi-layered analysis from regex-based patterns to sophisticated AI evaluation

## Key Differentiators

- **AI-Based Analysis**: Unlike traditional linting tools, Codex uses AI to understand context and intent
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous oversight during the development process, not just post-hoc analysis
- **Strategic Guidance**: Operates at a higher abstraction level than typical code assistants
- **Project-Aware**: Understands project goals and ensures code alignment with intended outcomes

## Scope

Codex is designed to work with:
- **GitHub repositories** (remote monitoring)
- **Local development environments** (real-time local monitoring)
- **Multiple AI code assistants** (universal compatibility)
- **Various programming languages and frameworks** (universal applicability)
