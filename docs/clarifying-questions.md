# Clarifying Questions for Codex Development

Based on the initial project description, here are key questions that need clarification to refine the project specification:

## Core Functionality Questions

### 1. Real-Time Monitoring Scope
- **Question**: When you mention "real-time monitoring," what is the expected latency? Should analysis happen on every keystroke, file save, or git commit?
- **Impact**: Determines the technical architecture and performance requirements
- **Options**: 
  - Keystroke-level (immediate feedback)
  - File save-level (practical real-time)
  - Commit-level (batch analysis)

### 2. AI Assistant Integration
- **Question**: Which specific AI assistants should Codex integrate with initially? (Claude, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, local models, etc.)
- **Impact**: Determines the MCP implementation priorities and integration complexity
- **Follow-up**: Should Codex work with multiple AI assistants simultaneously on the same project?

### 3. Code Generation vs. Code Review
- **Question**: Should Codex only monitor AI-generated code, or also analyze human-written code for consistency?
- **Impact**: Affects the scope and complexity of the analysis engine
- **Consideration**: Mixed human-AI workflows are common

## Technical Architecture Questions

### 4. Deployment Model
- **Question**: How should Codex be deployed?
- **Options**:
  - Cloud service (SaaS)
  - Local installation (CLI tool)
  - Hybrid (local agent + cloud analysis)
  - Self-hosted enterprise option
- **Impact**: Influences security, privacy, and scalability decisions

### 5. Analysis Depth
- **Question**: How deep should the AI analysis go?
- **Levels**:
  - Syntax and basic patterns (fast, lightweight)
  - Semantic understanding (moderate complexity)
  - Full project context and goal alignment (high complexity, high value)
- **Trade-off**: Analysis depth vs. performance and cost

### 6. Historical Context
- **Question**: How much historical project context should Codex maintain?
- **Considerations**:
  - Full project history vs. recent changes only
  - Multiple branch tracking
  - Long-term pattern learning vs. immediate analysis
- **Impact**: Storage requirements and analysis accuracy

## User Experience Questions

### 7. Feedback Mechanisms
- **Question**: How should Codex communicate findings to users?
- **Options**:
  - Immediate notifications/alerts
  - Dashboard/report view
  - IDE integration with inline comments
  - Email/Slack summaries
- **User Types**: Different approaches for humans vs. AI assistants

### 8. Configuration and Customization
- **Question**: How much should projects be able to customize Codex behavior?
- **Areas**:
  - Quality standards and thresholds
  - Analysis focus areas
  - Integration preferences
  - Notification settings
- **Balance**: Flexibility vs. simplicity

### 9. Learning and Adaptation
- **Question**: Should Codex learn and adapt to individual projects over time?
- **Implications**:
  - Project-specific pattern recognition
  - Custom rule development
  - Privacy considerations for learning data
- **Trade-off**: Personalization vs. standardization

## Business and Operational Questions

### 10. Target Users
- **Question**: Who is the primary target user?
- **Options**:
  - Individual developers using AI assistants
  - Development teams with shared standards
  - Organizations with multiple projects
  - AI assistant providers seeking quality feedback
- **Impact**: Feature prioritization and user interface design

### 11. Privacy and Security
- **Question**: What are the privacy requirements for code analysis?
- **Considerations**:
  - Local vs. cloud analysis
  - Code data retention policies
  - Integration with proprietary/sensitive codebases
- **Critical**: Many organizations have strict code privacy requirements

### 12. Success Metrics
- **Question**: How should Codex success be measured?
- **Potential Metrics**:
  - Reduction in AI code hallucinations
  - Improvement in code quality scores
  - Developer productivity metrics
  - Project goal achievement rates
- **Important**: Defines the value proposition and guides development priorities

## Integration Questions

### 13. GitHub Integration Scope
- **Question**: What level of GitHub integration is needed?
- **Features**:
  - Repository monitoring
  - Pull request analysis
  - Issue tracking integration
  - GitHub Actions integration
- **Access**: Public repos only or private enterprise repos?

### 14. Local Development Integration
- **Question**: Which development environments should be supported?
- **IDEs**: VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim/Neovim, etc.
- **Languages**: Priority order for language support
- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility requirements
